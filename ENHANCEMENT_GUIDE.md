## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### "File format not supported"
- **Solution**: Ensure file has supported extension (.xls, .xlsx, .csv, .gp, .txt, .tsv)
- **Tip**: Try converting to CSV format if other formats fail

#### "File appears to be empty"
- **Solution**: Check that file contains data and isn't corrupted
- **Tip**: Open file in a text editor to verify content

#### "Could not find year information"
- **Solution**: Ensure year data is present in a recognizable format
- **Supported formats**: 2023, 202301, FY-2023, 2023-24

#### "No data found after processing"
- **Solution**: Check file structure and ensure financial data is present
- **Tip**: Look for standard financial statement sections

### For .GP Files Specifically
- Ensure the file is text-based (not binary)
- Check that delimiters are consistent throughout the file
- Verify that year/date columns contain recognizable date formats
- Make sure financial metric names are clear and descriptive

## 📈 Performance Improvements

### Faster Processing
- **Smart file reading** with optimized engines
- **Efficient data parsing** with pandas optimizations
- **Reduced memory usage** through better data handling

### Better Reliability
- **Multiple fallback mechanisms** when primary methods fail
- **Comprehensive error catching** without app crashes
- **Graceful degradation** when partial data is available

## 🔍 Advanced Features

### Intelligent Metric Detection
The app now uses **pattern matching** to find financial metrics even when column names vary:

#### Cash Flow Metrics
- Operating activities, investing activities, financing activities
- Various naming conventions supported

#### Profit & Loss Metrics
- Revenue/sales, operating profit, net profit, gross profit
- Automatic margin calculations

#### Balance Sheet Metrics
- Assets, liabilities, equity, debt
- Automatic ratio calculations (current ratio, debt-to-equity)

### Flexible Year Parsing
Supports multiple year formats:
- **YYYY**: 2023
- **YYYYMM**: 202303 (March 2023)
- **YYYYMMDD**: 20230331 (March 31, 2023)
- **FY formats**: FY-2023, FY2023

## 📝 Best Practices

### File Preparation
1. **Clean your data** - Remove unnecessary rows/columns
2. **Consistent formatting** - Use consistent number formats
3. **Clear headers** - Use descriptive column/row names
4. **Proper encoding** - Ensure files are UTF-8 encoded for special characters

### For Optimal Results
1. **Test with sample data** first
2. **Keep backups** of original files
3. **Use consistent file naming** conventions
4. **Document** any custom formats or structures

## 🚨 Important Notes

### File Size Limits
- Streamlit default upload limit is 200MB
- For larger files, consider data preprocessing

### Data Security
- Files are processed locally and not stored permanently
- No data is transmitted to external servers

### Performance
- Processing time depends on file size and complexity
- Larger files may take longer to process and display

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues not covered in this guide:

1. **Check the error details** in the expandable error section
2. **Try converting** your file to CSV format
3. **Verify file structure** matches financial statement format
4. **Ensure data completeness** - no completely empty rows/columns
